# journal-application

I am currently working on an application that gives the ability for a parent to keep a digital journal of their children's life.
Beginning Features:
 - Login/Registration
 - Ability for user to create a child's profile
 - Log for information about the child like their weight and height at birth.
 - The ability to write about their child's day. If they learned something new, took their frist steps, laughed for the first time, etc.
 - The journal entry will have the ability to save pictures/videos of their child on that day. So it can act as both a photo album and memory journal.
Later Features:
 - Allows for posting by users to "friends" that they allow. This allows family and friends to be up to date on the child's memories and projects, too.
 - Allows multiple individuals to add memories to the child's journal. This allows grandparents and relatives to also be up-to-date and involved in the child's jounral.
 - Ability for users to order physical journals of the pictures/entries.
